          Hi, I’m Ahmed Mamdouh, an Electronics & Communication Engineering
          graduate passionate about web development, robotics, embedded systems,
          and problem-solving. I specialize in building clean, professional, and
          functional web applications using Angular, Bootstrap, and modern web
          technologies. I enjoy creating intuitive interfaces and designing
          efficient solutions that combine technology and creativity.

            I specialize in full-stack web development using the .NET ecosystem,
            building responsive, high-performance applications from end to end.
            On the backend, I use ASP.NET Core to design scalable RESTful APIs,
            implement clean architecture, and manage data through Entity
            Framework Core with SQL databases. On the frontend, I create
            engaging user interfaces using Angular, Bootstrap, and modern
            JavaScript/TypeScript practices, ensuring seamless integration with
            backend services.

            My journey started in the world of microcontrollers, firmware, and
            real-time systems, where I learned to write efficient, low-level C
            and C++ code to solve complex hardware problems. Over time, I
            expanded my skills into software engineering, applying the same
            precision and logical thinking to build scalable web applications.

          <p class="card-text" style="height: 250px; overflow-y: auto">
            I’ve always been passionate about problem-solving — understanding
            how things work, identifying what’s broken, and figuring out the
            most efficient way to fix or improve them. Whether I’m debugging a
            program, optimizing code performance, or designing a new feature, I
            approach every challenge as a puzzle to be solved. For me,
            problem-solving isn’t just about finding answers — it’s about
            thinking critically, analyzing patterns, and developing creative,
            logical solutions that truly make an impact.
